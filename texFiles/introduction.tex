\addcontentsline{toc}{subsection}{Similar App B [PLACEHOLDER]}

The main thing Studo offers is an app which combines both academic and campus services into one place.
For example, SETU Timetables for students and Moodle are two seperate platforms, but Studo combines these togethe and lets you access them from the same application.
They have partnerships and supply software to over 60 different universities across Germany and Austria.
Their mobile app has over 500,000 downloads, not including desktop downloads.

Bad things about Studo:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Many tools and featurs are admin controlled, not easy for students to customise what they see, etc
  \item Not accesible for students, looking at reviews it looks like students struggle connecting their student accounts to the application
  \item The calander is limited on what you can add/info you add to it
  \item Chat feature between students is heavily moderated and deletes things that don't go against the platforms rules
  \item 2FA and login features are unreliably and often don't work, affecting time pressured situations
\end{itemize}

Product Vision for Studo:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item FOR students and staff in universities or colleges
  \item WHO need a simple and efficient way to access sepereated resources, stay on track with campus events and resources, and communicate regularly with staff in their institution without constantly swapping between platforms.
  \item The Studo App is a mobile and desktop campus management and student services application
  \item THAT (key benefit)
  \item UNLIKE (primary competitive alternative)
  \item OUR PRODUCT (primary differentiation)
\end{enumerate}
